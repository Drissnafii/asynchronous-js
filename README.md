## Part 1: The "Veille" - Understanding the Concepts

This first part covers the theory behind *why* we need asynchronous code and how it has evolved in JavaScript.

### 1.1. What is Asynchronous Programming?

*   **Synchronous Code:** Executes line-by-line. If one line takes a long time (like a network request), the entire application freezes until it's done. This creates a bad user experience.

    ```javascript
    console.log("First");
    // This would block everything for 5 seconds in a real scenario
    // someLongRunningFunction(); 
    console.log("Second"); // This has to wait
    ```

*   **Asynchronous Code:** Allows long-running tasks to happen in the background without blocking the main thread. When the task is done, our code decides what to do next. This is essential for a responsive UI.

    ```javascript
    console.log("First");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("This message is shown after 2 seconds");
    }, 2000);
    console.log("Second");
    // Output: "First", "Second", "This message is shown after 2 seconds"
    ```

### 1.2. Method 1: Callbacks - The Foundation

A callback is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked later to complete some kind of action.

**The Problem: "Callback Hell"**
When you need to run multiple asynchronous operations in a sequence, you end up nesting callbacks inside each other. This creates a "Pyramid of Doom," which is hard to read and debug.

```javascript
// SIMULATED CALLBACK HELL
// Let's get a user, then their posts, then the comments for the first post.
getUser(1, (user) => {
  console.log("Got user:", user.name);
  getPosts(user.id, (posts) => {
    console.log("Got posts:", posts.length);
    getComments(posts.id, (comments) => {
      console.log("Got comments:", comments.length);
      // And it can get deeper and deeper...
    });
  });
});
```
This is why better solutions were needed!

### 1.3. Method 2: Promises - A Better Way

A `Promise` is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It can be in one of three states:
*   **Pending:** The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
*   **Fulfilled:** The operation completed successfully.
*   **Rejected:** The operation failed.

Promises allow us to "un-nest" our code using `.then()` for success and `.catch()` for failure.

```javascript
// The same sequence, but with Promises
getUser(1)
  .then(user => {
    console.log("Got user:", user.name);
    return getPosts(user.id); // Return the next promise
  })
  .then(posts => {
    console.log("Got posts:", posts.length);
    return getComments(posts.id); // Return the next promise
  })
  .then(comments => {
    console.log("Got comments:", comments.length);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error("Something went wrong:", error); // A single catch for all errors
  });
```
This is much flatter and more readable!

### 1.4. Method 3: Async/Await - Modern & Clean

`async/await` is "syntactic sugar" on top of Promises. It lets us write asynchronous code that *looks* synchronous, making it incredibly easy to read and understand.

*   `async`: You declare a function with `async` to tell JavaScript it will contain asynchronous operations.
*   `await`: You use `await` in front of any Promise to pause the function's execution until the Promise settles (is fulfilled or rejected).

```javascript
// The same sequence, but with Async/Await
async function displayUserContent() {
  try {
    const user = await getUser(1);
    console.log("Got user:", user.name);

    const posts = await getPosts(user.id);
    console.log("Got posts:", posts.length);

    const comments = await getComments(posts.id);
    console.log("Got comments:", comments.length);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Something went wrong:", error);
  }
}

displayUserContent();
```
This code is clean, intuitive, and uses the familiar `try...catch` block for error handling.

## Part 2: The "Live Coding" - Practical Application

Now, let's use these concepts to fetch real data from the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API.

### 2.1. The Challenge: Fetching API Data

Our goal is to:
1.  Fetch a list of users.
2.  Take the first user from the list.
3.  Fetch all the posts written by that user.
4.  Print the user's name and the titles of all their posts.

### 2.2. Solving it with Promises

We'll use the `fetch` API, which returns a Promise.

```javascript
// File: 2-promises/index.js

const API_URL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com";

fetch(`${API_URL}/users/1`)
  .then(response => response.json()) // Parse the JSON from the response
  .then(user => {
    console.log(`Fetching posts for user: ${user.name}`);
    return fetch(`${API_URL}/posts?userId=${user.id}`); // Fetch this user's posts
  })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(posts => {
    console.log(`Found ${posts.length} posts.`);
    posts.forEach(post => {
      console.log(`- ${post.title}`);
    });
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error("Request failed:", error);
  });
```

### 2.3. Solving it with Async/Await

Let's refactor the same logic to be even more readable.

```javascript
// File: 3-async-await/index.js

const API_URL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com";

async function fetchUserPosts(userId) {
  try {
    const userResponse = await fetch(`${API_URL}/users/${userId}`);
    const user = await userResponse.json();
    console.log(`Fetching posts for user: ${user.name}`);

    const postsResponse = await fetch(`${API_URL}/posts?userId=${user.id}`);
    const posts = await postsResponse.json();
    
    console.log(`Found ${posts.length} posts.`);
    posts.forEach(post => {
      console.log(`- ${post.title}`);
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Request failed:", error);
  }
}

fetchUserPosts(1);
```

### 2.4. Handling Multiple Operations with `Promise.all`

What if we want to fetch a user's details AND their photo album details at the same time? We don't need to wait for one to finish before starting the other. `Promise.all` is perfect for this. It takes an array of promises and waits for *all* of them to be fulfilled.

```javascript
// File: 4-promise-all/index.js

const API_URL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com";

async function fetchUserAndAlbums(userId) {
  try {
    const [userResponse, albumsResponse] = await Promise.all([
      fetch(`${API_URL}/users/${userId}`),
      fetch(`${API_URL}/albums?userId=${userId}`)
    ]);

    const user = await userResponse.json();
    const albums = await albumsResponse.json();

    console.log(`User Name: ${user.name}`);
    console.log(`Number of Albums: ${albums.length}`);
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("One of the requests failed:", error);
  }
}

fetchUserAndAlbums(1);
```

## Part 3: Asynchronous Error Handling

Proper error handling is crucial. Let's recap how it works for each method.

### 3.1. Error Handling in Callbacks

The "Error-First" pattern is a convention where the first argument to the callback is always reserved for an error object. If there is no error, it's `null`.

```javascript
fs.readFile('path/to/file', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Failed to read file:", err);
    return; // Stop execution
  }
  // Work with `data`
});
```

### 3.2. Error Handling in Promises (`.catch`)

You can add a `.catch()` block at the end of a promise chain. It will catch any rejection that happens in *any* of the preceding `.then()` blocks.

```javascript
getData()
  .then(...)
  .then(...)
  .catch(error => {
    // This single block handles all errors in the chain
    console.error(error);
  });
```

### 3.3. Error Handling in Async/Await (`try...catch`)

This is often the most intuitive method because it's the same pattern used for synchronous code. You wrap your `await` calls in a `try` block and handle any potential errors in the `catch` block.

```javascript
async function myFunc() {
  try {
    const result = await somePromiseThatMightFail();
    console.log(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("The operation failed:", error);
  }
}
```

## Conclusion & Key Takeaways

We've traveled through the history of asynchronous JavaScript, from the early days of callbacks to the modern elegance of `async/await`. Each step in this evolution was designed to solve the problems of the previous one, with the ultimate goal of making our code more **readable, maintainable, and robust**.

Here are the key things to remember:

*   âœ… **Callbacks:** The foundational pattern. They work, but they can quickly lead to nested, hard-to-read code known as **"Callback Hell"**.
*   âœ… **Promises:** A huge improvement. They allow us to **chain** asynchronous operations and handle all errors in a single `.catch()` block, making our code flatter and cleaner.
*   âœ… **Async/Await:** The current best practice. It's "syntactic sugar" over Promises, letting us write asynchronous code that **looks and feels synchronous**. It's the most readable and intuitive way to handle complex asynchronous flows.
*   âœ… **Error Handling is Crucial:** Never ignore potential errors in asynchronous code. `try...catch` with `async/await` is often the most straightforward and familiar approach.

Mastering these concepts is fundamental to writing modern, non-blocking, and efficient JavaScript applications, whether on the front-end or with Node.js on the back-end.
